# AI_search_algorithms_Maze
maze problem solved with AI algotirhms
summary
In this project, we use Python to implement a maze with different square cells that might
have a wall on each side, which has a starting cell and multiple target (end) cells. The maze
itself with all it’s components is read and made from a “.txt” file which was provided to us.
Our goal in this project was not only to implement the maze, but to also implement
different search algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, IDS, to find paths between our starting cell
and a target (end) cell and to compare their execution time, path length, etc.
